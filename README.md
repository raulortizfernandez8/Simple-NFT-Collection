# NFTCollection â€“ ERC721 on Arbitrum

A simple ERC721 NFT collection deployed on the Arbitrum blockchain. This project demonstrates a basic NFT smart contract with a limited supply, metadata hosted on IPFS, and minting functionality.

## Features

- **ERC721 standard** using OpenZeppelin contracts.
- **Limited supply** configurable during deployment (example: 3 tokens).
- **Minting function** allowing users to mint until total supply is reached.
- **Metadata on IPFS** for each token (JSON + image).
- **Events** emitted on each mint (`MintNFT`) to track ownership.
- **Compatible with marketplaces** like OpenSea (Arbitrum network).

## Contract Details

- **Contract Name:** `NFTCollection`
- **Network:** Arbitrum
- **Token Standard:** ERC721
- **Base URI:** Configurable for IPFS metadata
- **Total Supply:** Configurable on deployment
- **Minting:** Public (anyone can mint, configurable)

### Key Functions

- `mint()`
  - Mints a new NFT to the caller.
  - Emits `MintNFT` event with owner and token ID.
  - Requires that `currentTokenId < totalSupply`.

- `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`
  - Returns the metadata URI for a specific token.
  - Automatically appends `tokenId` to `baseUri` (e.g., `ipfs://QmABC123/0.json`).

## Deployment

The contract can be deployed was deployed in Foundry.  

Metadata Example
Each token JSON file stored on IPFS should follow this structure:

{
    "name":"BlockChain Economic Forum NFT 0",
    "description":"This is VIP ticket for the best seat in the Blockchain Economic Forum",
    "image":"ipfs://bafybeihnaatntecnf25vhnyun7vhb6txtoafgr56bwrndhv67leyejvd2m",
    "attributes":[
        {
            "trait_type": "Rarity",
            "value":"1"
        }
    ]
}

Images can be PNG, JPG, or GIF.

Attributes are optional but recommended for marketplaces.
